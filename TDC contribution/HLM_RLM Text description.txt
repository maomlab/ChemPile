# HLM_RLM

Dataset Description: The metabolic stability of compounds in Human and Rat Liver Microsomes is a crucial parameter in early-stage drug development. 
Compounds are classified as either stable or unstable based on their half-life. 
We have sanitized and reorganized the datasets derived from a published paper [1].

Task description: Binary classification. Given a drug SMILES string, predict the metabolic stability of the compound in Human and Rat Liver Microsomes.

Dataset statistics: HLM dataset: 6013 drugs, RLM dataset: 5590 drugs

Data split methods: Random split 
>>> from tdc.single_pred import ADME
>>> data = ADME(name = 'hlm')
# data = ADME(name = 'rlm')
>>> split = data.get_split()
